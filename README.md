# Astrie 

Use [Astrie](http://imarijoyborda.com/astrie/) to see and learn about NASA's beautiful APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) in any day. 

My motivation: I'm a space fan. I love how wide and mysterious the universe is, and I'm always amazed by NASA'S APOD. I love viewing the APOD daily online and read about it. But the sites that supports APOD often are not minimalist, and looks dull. Takes away the excitement of space to be honest. There is also no on the go way to see the APOD on other dates quickly. So, I created this minimalist and good looking site to see the daily APOD in a beatiful way and to allow fast checking out of APOD on other dates.

## How To Use
Select a date and press `Submit`. NASA's APOD on that day and it's description will be shown. APOD for the latest day is available within 24 hours (maximum, depending on timezone). 

Users can also press `Random APOD` to generate APOD on a random date.

By default, the latest available APOD is shown (or the day before, depending on timezone).

Some APOD are in video format. In this case, videos are played automatically and in a loop without sounds.

## How It's Made
This uses [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov). Tech used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
* Improve responsivenes
* Add links for social media sharing (twitter, facebook, etc.)
* Allow saving of image/video.

Contributions are also very welcome! Just issue a pull request.

## Thanks for checking it out!
